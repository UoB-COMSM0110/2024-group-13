## Game ideas

### Battle of the Tanks

In this game, one or two players manipulate their tanks to
protect the eagle against AI-controlled enemy tanks.
The map contains different kinds of walls and floors.
And there are various kinds of sporadic buffs.

**Twist** We can change it into a network versus game.
Two players battle against each other and AI tanks are
also divided into two sides.

**Challenges**
- network communication
- collision detection
- AI tanks
