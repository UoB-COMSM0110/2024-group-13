## Game idea 1 : Battle of the Tanks

In this game, one or two players manipulate their tanks to
protect the eagle against AI-controlled enemy tanks.
The map contains different kinds of walls and floors.
And there are various kinds of sporadic buffs.

**Twist:**
We can change it into a network versus game.
Two players battle against each other and AI tanks are
also divided into two sides.

**Challenges:**
- network communication
- collision detection
- AI tanks

Dive into a head-to-head competition to collect as many
points as possible while navigating through a maze filled
with challenges and surprises.

### Gameplay

Players aim to gather as many points as possible by
collecting coins scattered throughout the map. Each player
starts with 3 lives, and the goal is to avoid ghosts while
trying to outscore your opponent.

### Storyline

### Tank-man

Little Packie lived a happy life in his candy palace, until
one day … Some powerful ghosts invaded his palace and
created a mirror image of him, eating his precious candies! 

“Oh no! I’m gonna destroy you with all my abilities!
Let me be a TANK MAN!” So a mighty power growed inside
Packie and he became powerful Tankie, with some
destructive strength.

After years of evading ghosts on arcades, Pac realises the
only safe place really might just be underground!
He ventures into the caves, only to find another Pac-man
with the same idea. 

As they compete for resources, they discover that the
ghosts have followed them below. Armed with their pickaxes
and a torch illuminating their surroundings the two pacmen
must find a way to survive this subterranean nightmare...
for as long as they can.

Join us in this reimagined Pac-man adventure, where
strategy, agility, and a bit of luck will determine the
victor. Are you ready to break through walls and
claim victory?
