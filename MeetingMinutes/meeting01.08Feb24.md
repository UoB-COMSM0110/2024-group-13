# Minutes

## Things Done during Meeting

- Paper prototype re-recorded for the multiplayer
  pacman game.
- Discussing various ideas about how to make the game
  more interesting.
- Write the game story.
- Discussing ideas on game architecture

## Engineering procedures

- agile cycle
- UML documenting?
- Development with git branching

## Ideas

- whether pacman has shooting ability by default?
- how to implement teleport:
  - teleport destination placed by game randomly, player
    chooses whether to use it.
  - teleport destination choosed by player using mouse.
- different kinds of map darkness:
  - vision limited to a circle by default
  - limiting opponent's vision as a power-up
  - map mist: walls can always be seen, but other things
    can only be seen if within a circle

## TODO

- [ ] Upload paper prototype video for pacman game.
- [ ] Check fps settings and network communication
      for processing.
