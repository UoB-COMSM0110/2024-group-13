## Things To Do

- Smaller picture sizes; crop out transparent margins as much as possible; using png instead of jpg.
- Walls, coins, ghosts and powerups need to regenerate after a certain amout of time.
- Specify the start points of ghosts and pacman in the CSV.
- Fix the map border bug; maybe a visible map border.
- Game ends when one pacman loses all lives; game end page displaying total score. @Dan
- Simple, retro style image for pacman and ghosts; check whether GIF works in processing. @Haolan
- Simple instructions in pre-game/play page; maybe pop-up tutorials (harder to implement).
- Label in play page for current powerup; all powerup description in help page.
- Score/Life/Hp labels on play page. @Fin
- Network communication for online veriosn. @Yunpeng

## Hopefully a full version when we're back to school.
