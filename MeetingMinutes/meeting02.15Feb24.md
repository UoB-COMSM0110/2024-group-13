# Minutes

## Things Done during Meeting

- Created use case diagram for the game.
- Discussed the overall architecture of the game. (should be documentated)
- The 1st minimal version: start-page with an exit button.
- Discussed our engineering norms:
  - Use [trunk-based workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development),
  rather than [gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
  Will have a main branch and many feature branches.
  - Agile method: each feature shall be small.
  - Documentation for each feature: requirements, design.
  - Feature branch should be reviewed before merge into main branch.
  - Code style should be unified.
