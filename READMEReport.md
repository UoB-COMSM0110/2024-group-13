## Evaluation

### Qualitative Evalutations
We first did three types of qualitative evaluations at different points of the development process in order to have constant feedback and help navigate the final product design. This section will highlight the main results from the think aloud evaluation, heuristic evaluation and focus group.

#### Think Aloud Evaluation 11/03/2024

#### Heuristic Evaluation {DATE}

#### Focus Group 09/05/2024
Based off additional research, we found that hosting a focus group would provide further feedback. In this 40 minute session we asked the following quetions:

*How did you find playing the game?*
> P1 - Pretty good.
> P2 - I liked the traditional game play of Pac-Man but it was good to have the competition between players.
> P3 - Really cool, I really liked it.
